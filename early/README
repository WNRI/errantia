Erranta - conference broadcast system with slides
=================================================

Errantia is licensed under the AGPL 3.0 or later, as you can find in the
AGPL.txt provided with these files.

BEWARE
------
Errantia is not in a usable state. This is just out to show that it does exist
in case anyone would like to help. But as of now, it's very much work in
progress.

Install
-------
Install orbited and stompservice

Use
---

Edit graph.cfg to your liking.

Run
  orbited --config graph.cfg

That will run orbited and it's internal development web server. Only use this for
testing.

Now, run the push-script.

  python errantia_push.py

And write in conference name and the presentations along with how many slides.
