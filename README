ERRANTIA - open video streaming
=================================

Errantia is a collection of scripts making up a HTML5 video player with slide
sync, subtitle texting and chat.

It uses the latest web technologies including ajax push (comet) and html5. It is
made for streaming seminars and conferences live, facilitating two-way
communication.


There are two parts to Errantia;

* django-errantia which is a web service with chat, html5 video tag and slides.
* Errantia production which is two python programs for a) streaming live video
  and b) do live subtitling of the video.


How to use Errantia production
------------------------------

You first need to satisfy the dependencies. Which should be fixed by this in
Ubuntu:

   sudo apt-get install python-gst0.10 python-eventlet

You should probably copy errantia-default.conf to errantia.conf and make your
neccesary changes there, to send the video stream to your icecast server. You
only need to copy what you want to change.

You can also, if you like, save this file in your home folder, as .errantia

Then you can run errantia_prod.sh, to livestream directly from your camera do:

   dvgrab | ./errantia_prod.sh

You can now go to http://localhost:7000 and write some text, it should appear in
the video.

DVSwitch
--------
Errantia is often used in tandem with dvswitch.

You would run it like this;

   dvsink-command -h 0.0.0.0 -p 12345 -- ./errantia_prod.sh
